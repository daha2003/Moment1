# welcome 

My name is **Daniela Hasselgren** and I am a first year student at Mid University Sundsvall program for **Web Development**. 
As a part of **moment 1** (aka *first asignment*) we needed to create our very first **repo** and include a **README-dot-md** file. So here we are. 

### I like:
 - Raindrops on roses  
 - Whiskers on kittens
 -  Bright copper kettles 
 - Warm woolen mittens 
  - Cream colored ponies  
  - Crisp apple strudels 
  - Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes 
  - Silver white winters that melt into Springs

*Those are a few of my favourite things*
